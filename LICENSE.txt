-----------------------------------------------------------------
Acceptance
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to
them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Definitions
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The “licensor” is the individual or entity offering these terms,
and the “software” is the software the licensor makes available
under these terms.

“You” refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these terms.

“Your company” is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other
kind of organization that you work for, plus all organizations that
have control over, are under the control of, or are under common
control with that organization.  “Control” means ownership of
substantially all the assets of an entity, or the power to direct
its management and policies by vote, contract, or otherwise.
Control can be direct or indirect.

“Your licenses” are all the licenses granted to you for the
software under these terms.

“Use” means anything you do with the software requiring one of
your licenses.

“Your product” is any work you distribute or host, make available
as-a-service, or otherwise make available to others, that
incorporates or is derived from the software or for which the
software is a dependency.

“Personal use” means Use by an individual for strictly private,
personal purposes.  Personal use does not include Use by or for
the benefit of any for-profit or non-profit business, association,
organization, or governmental body.

“Noncommercial purpose” means a purpose other than (1) generating
a sale or revenue of any kind or (2) providing a service, software,
or work for a fee, subscription, or other consideration.

“Permitted purpose” means any personal, hobby, research, or
educational purpose that is also a noncommercial purpose.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Copyright License
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do
everything you might do with the software that would otherwise
infringe the licensor’s copyright in it **for any permitted
purpose**.  However, you may only distribute the software according
to “Distribution License” and make changes or new works based on
the software according to “Changes and New Works License”.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Distribution License
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
distribute copies of the software.  Your license to distribute
covers distributing the software with changes and new works
permitted by “Changes and New Works License”.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Notices
-----------------------------------------------------------------
You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the
software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the URL for
them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines beginning
with “Required Notice:” that the licensor provided with the
software.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes and New Works License
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to make
changes and new works based on the software for any permitted
purpose.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Patent License
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
applies for any permitted purpose.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Noncommercial Purposes Only
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Any other use of the software is **prohibited**, including all
commercial purposes.  (Examples of prohibited commercial purposes
would be running the software as part of a paid-for SaaS, selling
the software, incorporating it in a product you sell, or using it
internally at a for-profit business.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Proof of Compliance
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If the licensor asks, within thirty days you must show that you
are in compliance with these terms.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
No Warranty
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**THE SOFTWARE COMES “AS IS”, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY — WHETHER
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE.**  INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  YOU BEAR ALL RISK OF USING THE
SOFTWARE.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
implied warranties, so this disclaimer may not apply to you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Limitation of Liability
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR
THESE TERMS, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY.**  This limitation applies
even if the licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Termination
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If you fail to comply with these terms, your licenses end
automatically and immediately.  Your licenses end automatically if
the licensor publicly notifies you of your violation.  Your
licenses also end automatically if the licensor publicly notifies
any software freedom or open-source initiative that your licenses
should end for violation of these terms.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Disputes
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Any dispute arising under these terms will be governed by the laws
of the jurisdiction where the licensor is located, without regard
to conflict-of-law rules, and resolved exclusively in the courts of
that jurisdiction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
No Other Rights
-----------------------------------------------------------------
These terms do not provide any license or permission under any
intellectual-property right other than the rights expressly granted
above.  These terms do not limit, restrict, or otherwise affect any
lawful fair-use rights, or any use that is exempted by an
applicable exception or limitation to copyright infringement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Severability
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If any provision of these terms is unlawful, void, or
unenforceable, that provision is severable and the remainder of
these terms are valid and enforceable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
No Waiver
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The licensor may not waive a right under these terms except in a
signed, written agreement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Entire Agreement
-----------------------------------------------------------------
These terms embody all the terms of license between you and the
licensor concerning the software.
