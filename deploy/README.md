```bash
PROJECT_ROOT=/home/pi/pi-sound-logger   # Root path of the cloned project
VENV_NAME=venv                          # Name of the virtual environment folder
```

SERVICE_USER=pi                                   # User under which the service runs
PYTHON_BIN=/home/pi/pi-sound-logger/venv/bin/python  # Python binary used by the service
APP_ENTRY=src/main.py                             # Application entrypoint

##  Notes

* This file is sourced during deployment (`deploy.sh`) and must be present in the `deploy/` directory.
* If `variables.env` is missing or incomplete, the script will halt and prompt for correction.
* The values should be reviewed and updated to match your system setup before deployment.
